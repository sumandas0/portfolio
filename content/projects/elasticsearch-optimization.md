## Project Overview

Led the optimization of a large-scale Elasticsearch cluster serving millions of search requests daily. The project focused on improving search performance, reducing latency, and enhancing cluster stability.

## Challenge

The existing Elasticsearch cluster faced several challenges:
- High search latency (500ms+)
- Frequent cluster instability
- Resource utilization inefficiencies
- Limited scalability

## Solution

Implemented a comprehensive optimization strategy:

### 1. Cluster Architecture Improvements
- Redesigned shard allocation strategy
- Implemented dedicated master nodes
- Optimized node roles and responsibilities

### 2. Performance Optimizations
- Fine-tuned JVM settings
- Optimized index settings and mappings
- Implemented efficient query patterns
- Added caching layers

### 3. Monitoring & Stability
- Set up comprehensive monitoring
- Implemented automated scaling
- Enhanced backup and recovery procedures

## Results

- 90% reduction in search latency (from 500ms to 50ms)
- 50% improvement in overall search performance
- Enhanced cluster stability with 99.99% uptime
- Improved resource utilization by 40%

## Technical Details

### Key Technologies
- Elasticsearch 7.x
- Java 11
- Kubernetes
- Prometheus & Grafana

### Implementation Highlights
```java
// Example of optimized search query
SearchRequest request = new SearchRequest("products");
request.source(new SearchSourceBuilder()
    .query(QueryBuilders.matchQuery("name", searchTerm))
    .size(20)
    .trackTotalHits(true)
    .sort(SortBuilders.fieldSort("_score")));
```

## Lessons Learned

1. Importance of proper cluster sizing and planning
2. Value of comprehensive monitoring
3. Need for automated scaling mechanisms
4. Benefits of query optimization
